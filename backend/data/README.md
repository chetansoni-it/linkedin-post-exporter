# `data/` — CSV Data Storage

This directory stores the CSV files generated by the backend when `STORE_IN_CSV = True` (enabled by default).

## Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `linkedin_posts.csv` | All scraped LinkedIn posts received from the Chrome extension |

## CSV Format

The `linkedin_posts.csv` file has the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `author` | LinkedIn post author name |
| `timestamp` | Relative timestamp (e.g., "2h", "3d") |
| `emails` | Comma-separated emails extracted from the post |
| `contact_numbers` | Comma-separated phone numbers |
| `apply_links` | Comma-separated application/job URLs |
| `content` | Full text content of the LinkedIn post |
| `content_hash` | SHA-256 hash used for deduplication |
| `batch_number` | Sequential batch number from the Chrome extension session |
| `created_at` | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp when the post was stored |

## How It Works

- This directory and the CSV file are **created automatically** by the backend on first use.
- New posts are **appended** to the CSV — the file grows over time.
- **Deduplication** is handled via `content_hash` — duplicate posts are skipped.
- The CSV is the **default storage backend** when `STORE_IN_DB` is disabled.

## Configuration

In `app/config.py`:

```python
CSV_DIR = "data"                          # This directory
CSV_POSTS_FILE = "linkedin_posts.csv"     # The CSV filename
```

## ⚠️ Important

- Do **not** manually edit the CSV while the server is running — it may cause data corruption.
- To reset the data, stop the server and delete `linkedin_posts.csv`. It will be recreated on next startup.
- This file is **gitignored** — it contains scraped user data and should not be committed.
